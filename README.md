# Dragon-World
Dragon World is a text-based game that allows players to explore multiple dungeons that consist of enemies (dragons) or the routes to the next dungeons. The player can kill the enemies while the enemies can also kill the player. Each dungeon contains gold. After collecting all golds and kill all enemies, the player will go to the next level and the game will become more and more complex. At the end of the gameplay, the player (hero) would eventually save the princess that was caught by those enemies.

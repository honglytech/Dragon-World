# Dragon-World
Dragon World is a text-based game that allows players to explore multiple dungeons that consist of enemies (dragons) or the routes to the next dungeons. The player can kill the enemies while the enemies can also kill the player. Each dungeon contains gold. After collecting all golds and kill all enemies, the player will go to the next level and the game will become more and more complex. At the end of the gameplay, the player (hero) would eventually save the princess that was caught by those enemies.

# Software Required to Compile 
- Unity 
- Visual Studio or MonoDevelop

# Henry comments 13/April:
- You need many more commits per week to pass.
- So far I can't see any useful code, nor any text-based data files.

# Henry's Comments 27/April
- compile instructions + directory explanation still missing (just saying "Unity" and "Visual Studio" doesn't tell me which to use in what order)
- still no data for your game? That needs attention very very soon, as you can't start writing and developing your game world until you can load game data files.
